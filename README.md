# 🐢 Catch The Turtle Game

This project is a simple reflex game developed using Python's `turtle` library. The goal is to click on randomly appearing turtles on the screen to earn points. 🎯

## 🚀 How It Works?
1. **Turtles** appear randomly on the screen at specific intervals.
2. The player **clicks on the turtles** to score points.
3. The game requires **quick reflexes** and **attention**!
